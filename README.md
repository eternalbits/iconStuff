# About Icons - Convert ICO and ICNS disk images

### How to Install "Icons"

You can find a brief description on the [`share`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/share/) 
page. Currently only command line input is available, but I rely on this to project 
a screen similar to that of CompactVD.

### What is "Icons"?

"Icons" is primarily a version that allows you to translate from [Microsoft Windows
ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)) to [Apple macOS
ICNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format) and vice versa.
Currently, the application consists of switching between PNG images, as both 
functions have this tool, [`Microsoft's bitmap`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/java/icons/src/io/github/eternalbits/bitmap/)
that is present in ICO and [`Apple's compression`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/java/icons/src/io/github/eternalbits/apple/) 
that is present in ICNS.

The app finally has [a window](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/releases)!

The --icon parameter means a format of choice for your icons.

Both files can be viewed with the [XnView MP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/) tool.

#### Microsoft's ICO
`--icon 0=png;1=png;2=*;3=*;4=png;5=*;6=*;7=bit`

The phrase for the ICO consists of
- Number that appears in front of fileIcons
- Description of the respective icon: BIT, PNG or * (which means that
this icon should be deleted)

#### Apple's ICNS
`--icon 1=ic13:png;2=ic11:png;3=ic04:bit;4=png`

The sentence for the ICNS consists of
- Number that appears in front of fileIcons
- Description of the respective icon: BIT, PNG or *
- Description of [`Icon types`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format#Icon_types).
In reality this is a description of length 3 or 4, and nothing is
validated regarding its origin. It only works if the icon type is
correct.

#### PNG
`--icon 1=*;3=*;4=png;6=*`

The sentence for PNG consists of
- Number that appears in front of fileIcons
- Description of the respective icon: PNG or * (it is always the
largest icon that is selected)
