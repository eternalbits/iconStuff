# About Icons - Convert ICO and ICNS disk images

### How to Install "Icons"

You can find a brief description on the [`share`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/share/) 
page. Currently only command line input is available, but I rely on this to project 
a screen similar to that of CompactVD.

### What is "Icons"?

"Icons" is primarily a version that allows you to translate from [Microsoft Windows
ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)) to [Apple macOS
ICNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format) and vice versa.
Currently, there are only two versions that translate icons to PNG, as both 
functions have this tool, and a version that translates between [`Apple's 
compression`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/java/icons/src/io/github/eternalbits/apple/) 
and [`Microsoft's bitmap`](https://github.com/eternalbits/iconStuff/tree/main/java/icons/src/io/github/eternalbits/bitmap/).

Both files can be viewed with the [XnView MP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/)
 tool.

### Future advancements of "Icons":
- Adding a window.
